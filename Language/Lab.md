# Language
Cognitive services has a language offering which can be integrated into applications, websites and tools, allowing real-time translation of 60+ supported languages, analysis of sentiment, key phrase extraction, and much more. Weâ€™ll also look at an example of how we can add language understanding with LUIS to make our bots and applications smarter.

## Lab - create a LUIS model that can be used in a hospital
In this lab you'll be using LUIS to create a language model that can classify the intents and entities of an utterance. We'll then test and improve our model using new utterances.

### Part 1 - Create the language understanding app

1. Navigate to [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai/home), and sign in.
2. Create a New App
* Name: Oxford
* Culture: English
* Description: Hospital application

### Part 2 - Add the 'FreeBed' intent
1. The first intent we are going to add is one that will trigger when we want to find a free bed in the hospital which we're going to name the 'FreeBed' intent.
* Go to Intents and select `Create new intent`
* Intent name: FreeBed
2. Now we're going to add some example utterances. Add the following:
* 'Where is there a free bed?'
* 'Where can I find a free bed?'
* 'Is there a bed free?'

### Part 3 - Add the 'Ward' entity
1. Now it might be the case that we want to search for a bed on a specific ward. That's a piece of information we'd need if we wanted to query our database, so we're going to make an entity to detect it. We're going to go to Entities > Create new entity.
* Entity name: Ward
* Entity type: List. We've selected this one because the ward names in a hospital, for the most part, are a fixed list of values. If a new ward was created it'd be very simple to add it to the list. 
* Values: 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c
2. Go back to Intents > FreeBed and enter the following utterances:
* 'Where is there a free bed on ward 1a?'
* 'Where can I find a free bed on ward 1b?'
* 'Is there a bed free on ward 2c?'
You can see that the Ward entity has been automatically tagged because they are pre-defined values in our entity list.

### Part 4 - Add the 'FindPatient' intent
1. The next intent we're going to add is one that will help us find a specific patient. Let's go to Intents > Create a new intent.
* Intent name: FindPatient
2. Add the following utterances:
* 'Where can I find John Smith'
* 'Where is John Smith?'
* 'Where's John Smith?'
You'll see we've got an entity here that we want to pick out, and that's the name of the patient, so let's make that now.

### Part 5 - Add the 'Patient' entity
1. Go to Entities > Create new entity
* Entity name: Patient
* Entity type: Simple
2. Names come in many different forms, we're going to help our model understand what a name is by providing it some examples. We can do this with a phrase list.
* Go to Phrase lists > Create new phrase list
* Name: Patient
* Copy the list of names from the file 'full-names.txt' and press enter. You'll see them added to the phrase list values.
* Add your name to the list and press enter
* Click save
3. Go back to Intents > FindPatient
* Click on 'John' and then move the cursor over to 'Smith' and click, so that the square braces include the entire name. Label it 'Name'.
* Do the same with the other utterances. 

### Part 6 - Train the model
1. Click the train button in the upper right!
2. Click the test button in the upper right.
3. Type a test utterance e.g. 'Where is Alice Richards?'
